AGE
===

Another Game Engine for Haxe js (Only supports Haxe 2.x for the moment)

AGE is a minimal game engine for making HTML5 games

Version 0.1


Development build
-----------------

Just run this command line into your terminal

```bash
haxelib git AGE https://github.com/po8rewq/AGE src
```

Add the lib to your project

```bash
-lib AGE

# Or just clone the repo and add this :
-cp /age/directory/src/
```

Until the Haxe 3 release, you will need the HTML5 externals
