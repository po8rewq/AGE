AGE
===

Another Game Engine for Haxe and NME

Version 0.4

Development build
-----------------

You need to have ant installed to build a development version of AGE.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/po8rewq/AGE.git
ant
```

This will remove AGE from haxelib (in case there is the same version already installed), build the ProjectCreator, and install AGE.


Setup
-----

You can setup a new project by executing the haxelib run command.

For more details :

```bash
haxelib run AGE help
```
